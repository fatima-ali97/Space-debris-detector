                <br>
                <p>The project idea came from "Al-Mundhir" Bahrain's first satellite, was launched,
                    which was designed and developed by Bahraini hands by engineers from the National
                    Space Science Authority.
                    <br>
                    We decided to implement an AI space debris detector to help the National Space Science
                    Authority to change the orbit of the satellite if there is any debris recognized in its
                    direction utilizing the camera that is installed on the satellite.
